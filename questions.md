## Potential Research Questions

*from [Stanford DAO Workshop](https://twitter.com/lund_dane/status/1565823237174415360?s=20&t=JFxXUhgjoJ1WFEQ9UJPeGQ):*

> How do DAOs win (where are they the optimal organizational form)?
>
> How can DAOs improve their operational efficiency?
>
> How to create a system of peer review to reach consensus on standard vocab / terms?
>
> What do DAOs do today? How can we make governance maximally useful?
>
> How do we rightsize rules and structures for DAOs to fulfill their purpose?
>
> How can we create optimal incentive structures for bounties?

*from [Evolution of Decentralized Governance](https://youtu.be/igyYHRf0-aw?t=3297) by Andrew Hall:*

> Who participates and why? How can we increase informed participation? Can tokens be designed to incentivize contributions?
>
> What coalitions form, and where? Can there be stable coalitions that clarify stakes of decisions for stakeholders?
>
> How do different governance structures change who participates, what is proposed, what outcomes are produced, and which organizations ultimately succeed?
