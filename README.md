# MultiGov Challenge
## Community-driven Research-a-thon

This 3-month program involves collaborative projects intended to answer open questions about DAOs. Registered participants will have an opportunity to earn rewards for contributing research. Ultimately, our goal is to bring valuable insights to builders at ETHDenver, so we might have *research-driven bounties* to solve real problems with better governance systems.

### Timeline

October - January

### What is MultiGov

We are building a decentralized autonomous “think tank” a.k.a. policy DAO. This experimental organization intends to facilitate open systems of participatory action research for a community of ecosystems. Our supporters will be funding projects to answer important questions and explore relevant topics, including:

1. Treasury Management (Grants+)
2. Community Facilitation
3. DAO Compliance

Valid submissions (due in January) will consist of a document and a slideshow presentation. There will be milestones along the way, intended to guide participants through the research process.
